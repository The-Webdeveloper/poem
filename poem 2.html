    <h1> POEM 2 </h1>

    <h2> MOON </h2>

    <p>In the velvet sky, a silver hush,<br>
        The moon, a whisper, draped in blush,<br>
        Hung low and soft, a lantern's gleam,<br>
        Casting dreams on night's dark seam. <br> <br>
        
        With tides it dances, ocean's guide,<br> 
        A silent sentinel of the night,<br>
        In phases shifting, waxing, waning,<br>
        Her face a canvas, ever-changing. <br> <br>
        
        Beneath her gaze, the world transforms, <br>
        The quiet fields, the storm-tossed swarms, <br>
        She bathes the earth in gentle light, <br>
        A balm to soothe the day's last fight. <br> <br>
        
        Her pale embrace, a tender kiss, <br>
        Transforms the mundane into bliss, <br>
        A silent witness to the stars, <br>
        She weaves their stories, near and far. <br> <br>
        
        Oh moon, your journey through the sky, <br>
        A lullaby to those who lie, <br>
        In peaceful slumber, dreams unfurled, <br>
        You keep the secrets of the world. <br> <br></p>
