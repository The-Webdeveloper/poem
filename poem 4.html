    <h1>POEM 4</h1>

    <h2>SUNSET</h2>

    <p> As day surrenders to the night, <br>
        The sun descends, a fiery sight, <br>
        A canvas brushed with shades of gold, <br>
        Where evening’s tale begins to unfold. <br> <br>
        
        The horizon glows with amber fire, <br>
        And skies are painted with desire, <br>
        Crimson and violet softly blend, <br>
        In twilight’s arms, the day will end. <br> <br>
        
        The clouds, adorned in hues so rare, <br>
        Float gently through the cooler air, <br>
        A serenade of light and shade, <br>
        In quiet splendor, softly laid. <br> <br>
        
        The sun, a molten orb of grace, <br>
        Sinks slowly down, leaves its trace, <br>
        And twilight whispers, soft and low, <br>
        The promise of a night’s soft glow. <br> <br>
        
        As shadows stretch and daylight wanes, <br>
        The sky is filled with starry veins, <br>
        A fleeting blush of day’s embrace, <br>
        Transforms the world, then fades from space. <br> <br>
        
        In sunset’s hush, a fleeting kiss, <br>
        A moment wrapped in tranquil bliss, <br>
        Before the night’s serene refrain, <br>
        Bids farewell to the sun again. <br> <br></p>
