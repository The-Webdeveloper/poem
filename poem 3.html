    <h2> SUNFLOWERS </h2>

    <p>In fields where summer's breath is sweet, <br>
        A golden army stands in fleet, <br>
        Their faces turned to dawn's embrace, <br>
        Sunflowers shine with open grace. <br>
        
        Tall and bold with stems of green, <br>
        They wear the sun like a bright sheen, <br>
        Each petal, bright as morning's gold, <br>
        A story of the warmth they hold. <br> <br>
        
        With every sunrise, heads arise, <br>
        To drink the light from azure skies, <br>
        Their joyous dance in daylight's gleam, <br>
        A tribute to a sunny dream. <br> <br>
        
        In gentle breeze, they sway and lean, <br>
        A sea of yellow, calm and serene, <br>
        As if they know the sun's own art, <br>
        And mirror light from heart to heart. <br> <br>
        
        When twilight falls and shadows play, <br>
        Their golden crowns begin to sway, <br>
        Yet still they turn to skies above, <br>
        In silent faith and silent love. <br> <br>
        
        O sunlit bloom, with gaze so wise, <br> 
        You turn to where the daylight lies, <br>
        A beacon in the summer's hour, <br>
        Eternal symbol of the flower. <br> <br>
